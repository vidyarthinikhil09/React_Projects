# Color Toggle App

This project is a simple React application that allows users to change the background color of the screen by clicking on different color buttons.

## Features

- **Dynamic Background Color**: The app dynamically updates the background color of the screen based on the button clicked by the user.
- **Responsive Design**: The UI is designed to be responsive and works well on various screen sizes.
- **Ease of Use**: Users can simply click on any of the provided buttons to see immediate changes in the background color.

## How It Works

1. The `useState` hook is used to manage the `color` state, which determines the background color of the main container.
2. Each button has an `onClick` event handler that updates the `color` state with a new color value.
3. The main container's `style` attribute uses the `color` state to dynamically set its `backgroundColor` property.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your machine.
- Basic knowledge of React.js.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd color-toggle-app
   ```
3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

1. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
2. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.
3. Click on the color buttons at the bottom of the screen to change the background color.

## Code Overview

### Main Component

- **`App` Component**: The core of the application.
  - Manages the `color` state using React's `useState` hook.
  - Renders a full-screen div with a dynamic `backgroundColor`.
  - Displays a set of buttons to toggle the background color.

### Button Functionality

Each button:
- Is styled using inline CSS for its background color.
- Contains an `onClick` handler that sets the `color` state to the respective color value.
